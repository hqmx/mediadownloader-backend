**Project**: YouTube downloader (Node.js + yt-dlp)
**Issue**: YouTube HTTPS connections via SmartProxy fail with SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL after EC2 deployment

**Progress**:
- ✅ Local environment: Works perfectly
- ✅ EC2 + HTTP proxy: Connection successful (httpbin.org test)
- ❌ EC2 + HTTPS proxy: YouTube blocks connection (SSL handshake failure)

**Current Status**:
- Video download: Works (low quality, legacy system)
- Video analysis: Fails due to SSL issues (yt-dlp + proxy)

**Root Cause**: YouTube detects proxy IP range + TLS fingerprint mismatch and blocks SSL connections

**Question**: When YouTube blocks HTTPS connections even through residential proxies, what solutions have worked for you? Any experience with SSL passthrough or TLS fingerprint spoofing?

**Technical Details**:
```bash
# Works
curl --proxy http://user:pass@proxy.smartproxy.net:3120 http://httpbin.org/ip

# Fails
curl --proxy http://user:pass@proxy.smartproxy.net:3120 https://www.youtube.com
# Error: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL
```
